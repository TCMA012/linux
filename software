Unlike Google Chrome, which has an automatic software update included, 
Chromium does not update itself or prompt the user to install an update.
In Ubuntu, Chromium (like other pieces of software that are installed on your computer) will update automatically when a new version is available. Updates are controlled by an application called Update Manager.
Depending on how you've configured Update Manager, it will check for updates at the following intervals:

    Daily
    Every two days
    Weekly
    Every two weeks

When Update Manager finds updated software, it will automatically launch. You can also launch Update Manager by selecting 
System > Administration > Update Manager. 
If you manually launch Update Manager, you'll need to click the Check button for Update Manager to check for new versions of software.
